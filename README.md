# Police Incident Reporter

This repository hosts an unofficial SFPD incident reporter website:

https://pedrojrv.github.io/Police_Incident_Reporter/

This website was created for educational purposes. The database is updated daily at 10:00 AM PST. The repository, and consequently the website, are also udpated daily by simply running the `src/updater.py` script.
