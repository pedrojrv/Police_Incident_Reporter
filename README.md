# Police Incident Reporter

This repository hosts an unofficial SFPD incident reporter website:

- https://pedrojrv.github.io/Police_Incident_Reporter/

This website was created for educational purposes. The database is updated daily at 10:00 AM PST. The repository, and consequently the website, are also udpated daily by simply running the `src/updater.py` script. More information on the official dataset can be found in the following websites:

- https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783
- https://data.sfgov.org/profile/edit/developer_settings
- https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.sfgov.org/wg3w-h783

The `notebook` directory contains the `main.ipynb` notebook. It contains all the code necessary for creating and updating the website. It is the same code as in the `src/updater.py`.
